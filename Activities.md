# Other Activities
This year we will be hosting a Capture the Flag (CtF) competition and application security workshops sponsored by GE Digital.

## CtF

This time GE Digital will host the CTF competition! The CTF will feature all sorts of challenges where you will have the opportunity to show your skills and win great prizes.
Amongst the challenges you will be able to find web exploitations, reverse engineering, crypto and many more challenges. Competitors could use the knowledge from the "Advanced Application Security" workshop to solve some of the challenges.

### Prizes

## Advanced Application Security Workshop

GE Digital will host the advanced application security workshop! 

GE Digital security researchers will host several sessions about different aspects of advanced application security, in different phases of the application such as development and deployment.

The security researchers will share some of the critical vulnerabilities that were found in the research lab, demonstrate them and will deep dive into the root cause of these vulnerabilities. 

The following sessions will take place:

- Breaking Clouds

- Cache me if you can

- Exploiting Authentication Issues For Fun And 25,000$

Attendees could gain a hands-on experience by attacking either the systems that were built for the workshop or the CtF's challenges.

During the breaks you will have the opportunity to hear more from the security researchers about the security challenges in the exciting world of Industrial IoT, and cloud based environments. 

### Breaking Clouds

**Presenter:** Eran Shmuely

**Time:** 10:05 (2 hours)

**Level:** Advanced

With over half of the fortune 500 on board, Cloud Foundry is considered to be the world's leading cloud platform. In this session, we will show some very interesting vulnerabilities that we identified and responsibly disclosed over this year to the platform's maintainers. We will discuss issues in working with zip files, using parameters in ruby-rack as well as various cases of time-of-check vs time-of-use and expand on each issue with a barrage of real world examples.

In the second part of the session we will work out how migrating applications to a cloud environment might open them up to new and exciting vectors that are otherwise considered unexploitable.

We will see how with new technologies come new vulnerabilities and sometimes, it's just the old vulnerabilities that are making a comeback.

Attendees could perform the learnt attacks on a pre-configured environment during the workshop.

### Cache me if you can

**Presenter:** Amit Kaplan

**Time:** 12:50 (1 hour)

**Level:** Intermediate

Hash functions are all around us, being used for a variety of applications such as data integrity verification, de-duplication algorithms and as pointer generators in hash-tables. In this session a security researcher from GE Digital will discuss and demonstrate the differences between cryptographic and none-cryptographic hashes, generating collisions and performing cache poisoning and timing attacks against applications that use hashing naively.

Attendees could perform the learnt attacks on a pre-configured environment during the workshop.

### Exploiting Authentication Issues For Fun And 25,000$**

**Presenter:** Michael Reizelman

**Time:**  14:15 (2 hours)

**Level:** Advanced

Authentication mechanisms are considered to be the most sensitive part of any application and yet they seem to be some of the most prone for implementation errors. In this session, the security researcher will discuss how he broke the authentication mechanisms for some of biggest applications in the world (Uber, Yahoo, Twitter, etc.). He will present advanced practical ways of exploiting SSO mechanisms such as SAML and OAuth, user invitations and password reset mechanisms.

In the second part of this session we will examine how CSP(Content Security Policy) helped to fix one of the vulnerabilities and we will elaborate about the various security-related HTTP security headers that described by The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

a security researcher from GE Digital will discuss what each one of these headers does to help augment web application security and under what circumstances they could be bypassed by a clever adversary.

Attendees could perform the learnt attacks on a pre-configured environment during the workshop.
