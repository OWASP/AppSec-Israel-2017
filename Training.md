## Training Day

**This year, we are adding a free, 1 day training event before the regular Conference.**   

This training is **NOT** for security experts with many years of experience, but for the rest of us:   
This is a hands-on, crash course in application security for developers, QA engineers, and anyone new to the AppSec field! 

The Training Day is free to attend, however [registration is required](Register). 

**Date:** October 17, 2017  
**Time:** 9:00am - 5:00pm   
**Location:** [College of Management in Rishon](Location).

### What is this Training about? 

Application-level attacks have become the typical organization daily routine, with numerous automated attack &   
exploitation engines from anywhere in the globe constantly scanning web sites, web services and external interfaces.  

Ever wondered how itâ€™s done? Having dreams of being a professional hacker? or of being able to fortify your   
apps against them? Need to fund your beer with bug bounty prizes?

This crash course trains the participants in the basic toolset, in penetration testing skills and in secure development practices.   
It will cover the methodologies, common toolsets and over 7+ different high impact attack vectors, as well as the   
code-level techniques required to mitigate these attacks.

#### Goals   

The Training aims to introduce the audience into the field of **application-level attacks** and **white-hat hacking   
methodologies**, as well as the corresponding **secure coding best-practices**, and provide the basic tools, understanding   
and processes required for assessing the security of modern web applications.   

It's aim is to enable trainees get the initial understanding and hands-on skills required to find their path in the appsec field,   
whether as an appsec professional or as a developer of secure, resilient, and robust code.

### OWASP World Tour   

The AppSecIL Training Day is part of the global [OWASP World Tour](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_World_Tour) (OWT).   
OWASP is committed to improving the quality of the world's software security.   
We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem   
because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.  
As part of this Philosophy, OWASP is offering basic AppSec training for Developers in   
hopes of including security throughout the entire SDLC. 
In addition to AppSecIL, OWT Trainings will also take place in [Boston](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2017_Global_World_Tour_Boston) and [Tokyo](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2017_OWASP_World_Tour_Tokyo).

In accordance with the organization's [2017 strategic goal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Strategic_Goals), we are targeting an audience of 500 developers   
for this Training Day, and it will be delivered by a Professional Trainer, hired by OWASP.
