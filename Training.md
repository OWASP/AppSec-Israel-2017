### OWASP World Tour   

The AppSecIL Training Day is part of the global [OWASP World Tour](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_World_Tour) (OWT).   
OWASP is committed to improving the quality of the world's software security.   
We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.  
As part of this Philosophy, OWASP is offering basic AppSec training for Developers in hopes of including security throughout the entire SDLC. 
In addition to AppSecIL, OWT Trainings will also take place in [Boston](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2017_Global_World_Tour_Boston) and [Tokyo](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/2017_OWASP_World_Tour_Tokyo).

In accordance with the organization's [2017 strategic goal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Strategic_Goals), we are targeting an audience of 500 developers for this Training Day, and it will be delivered by a Professional Trainer, hired by OWASP.
