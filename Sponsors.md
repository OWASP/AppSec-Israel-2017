## Sponsorships

Whether you have a product to showcase, offering a service, or you are recruiting - sponsoring the OWASP AppSec Israel Conference gets you the right exposure. This year we are expecting over 700 attendees, including security professionals, developers, managers, and more.

Sponsorship also helps support the OWASP community, and ensures that we can keep on making our conferences better and better. Sponsorship fees are intended to cover the costs of the conference only. Since the conference is open to all and free of charge to attend, we need your support to enable us to put on a great conference.

We are now offering Silver, Gold and Platinum sponsorship levels. There is also a cost-effective “Community Supporter” option for non-profits, government offices, small startups, and such. For more details on the available sponsorship options please see [Conference Sponsorships]({{ site.url }}/assets/AppSecIL_2017_Sponsorships.pdf).
